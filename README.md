# C211-Final-Project-Anything
C211-Final Project for group Anything

The goal of this project was to create an application for a car rental service.
A user can create an account, add a vehicle, and also remove the vehicle from
their account. If the user tries adding another vehicle to their account if
one is already added they will receive an error due to already having a vehicle
in their account.
