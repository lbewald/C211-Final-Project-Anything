# C211-Final-Project-Vehicle Rental Application
C211-Final Project for group Vehicle Rental Application

The goal of this project was to create an application for customers to use for a
car rental service. A user can create an account, add a vehicle, and also remove the
vehicle from their account but, if a user tries adding another vehicle to their account if
one is already added they will receive an error due to a one vehicle limit being implemented.

Source files: Accounts.txt
This is a text file where the users will be added to when they a created, this includes the users username and password they make.
